Hello, it's Eylon Mazor and Tal Musari :) :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: <br/>
We developed this application as a final project as part of a B.S.c degree in Computer Science at Hadassa Academic College Jerusalem.<br/>
The app is designed to serve all IDF soldiers - in order to save them a long and exhausting process.<br/>
We were both fighters in the army (Golani and Palsar 401) so we both know well the process of calibrate weapons,<br/>
and from that - we decided to try to develop an app that will streamline the process for everyone around - both in terms of time and money.<br/>
Hope you use and get help with this app!
<br/><br/>
Good luck! :sunglasses:
